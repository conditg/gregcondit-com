A Reinforcement Learning Paradigm Guaranteed to Achieve Human-Level AGI,a-reinforcement-learning-paradigm-guaranteed-to-achieve-human-level-agi,5c7abed29254e91678c127ab,640750fa10ca9561e4a86468,Tue Mar 07 2023 14:58:02 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Mar 07 2023 14:58:21 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Mar 07 2023 15:00:37 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c7abed29254e9f90fc127aa/640750f1237e238f635dc20f_1675889442085.jpeg,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c7abed29254e9f90fc127aa/640750f7bca0e9b8cbc35fc4_SCR-20230307-dt2.jpeg,We've figured out how to create human-level intelligence...just not quickly or cheaply.,"<p><em>See the original post at </em><a href=""https://ae.studio/blog/a-reinforcement-learning-paradigm-guaranteed-to-achieve-human-level-agi""><em>ae.studio</em></a></p><p>‍</p><p id="""">AE Studio is proud to announce an amazing Reinforcement Learning paradigm that is guaranteed to achieve the performance of a human-level AGI. The technology yields an emergent intelligence via a unique combination of neural networks and genetic algorithms. The resulting intelligence is both generalized, and able to adapt and improve over time.</p><p id="""">The AI is capable of learning from its experiences, adjusting its behavior in response to different, even novel circumstances, and achieving goals through trial and error. It has demonstrated that it is wholly capable of handling a wide range of tasks and applications, from driving cars, to delivering complex medical diagnoses, to even composing parodies.</p><p id="""">Among the key features of this AI is its ability to learn from human interactions. It, with a high rate of success, can understand and respond to human emotions, making interactions feel more natural and intuitive.</p><p id="""">The AI is also equipped with advanced natural language processing capabilities, allowing it to understand and respond to human speech and text. This makes it ideal for use in customer service, education, and other applications where human interaction is a critical component.</p><p id="""">This remarkable paradigm is not without drawbacks. The AI can take 15-20 years of training to achieve sufficient general competency, as is required for public deployment. In certain cases, upwards of 30 years of training are needed to achieve doctoral-level intelligence (or equivalent) in specific domains. Recent studies show that training costs are especially high between years 18 and 22. Additionally, the AI requires near-constant supervision and behavior-shaping for the first 10-15 years. Insufficient supervision during these formative years can result in a dysfunctional intelligence system that can underperform, or in some cases even be considered misaligned with societal expectations.</p><p id="""">AE Studio further notes that the AI Agents express preferences towards specific domains of knowledge, and these preferences typically don’t emerge until after at least 5-10 years of training. The relationship between these preferences and the specific behavior reinforcement techniques during training is not well understood. Parties seeking expertise in a specific domain are therefore encouraged to train multiple AI Agents at once, increasing the odds that in time, at least one Agent demonstrates preference for the sought-after domain.</p><p id="""">AE Studio has refrained from overly-detailed descriptions of how to create these AI agents, but did reveal that the process includes a human male, a human female, and a waiting list of approximately nine months. For those with more urgent requirements, AE Studio reportedly has a large number of successfully trained agents with domain expertise in programming, machine learning, and blockchain available for hire.</p><p id="""">AE Studio is excited to bring this technology to the world, and looks forward to seeing the impact it will have on the future of AI and human interaction.</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://calendly.com/ae-studio-bd/happy-people-fun-conversations?ref=ae-studio"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Schedule a call</a> with one of our human-level-intelligence agents today or <a href=""https://ae.studio/join-us?ref=ae-studio"" target=""_blank"" id="""">become one yourself</a>!</p><p>‍</p>",startups,john-smith,
My Data Science Boot Camp Experience,ds-boot-camp,5c7abed29254e91678c127ab,5fc5087365a014541342a739,Mon Nov 30 2020 14:57:55 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Wed Jan 04 2023 15:48:55 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Mar 07 2023 15:00:37 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c7abed29254e9f90fc127aa/5fc50994793d41854a993205_jefferson-santos-9SoCnyQmkzI-unsplash.jpg,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c7abed29254e9f90fc127aa/5fc50994793d41854a993205_jefferson-santos-9SoCnyQmkzI-unsplash.jpg,"Advice for anyone considering a boot camp, and my review of Thinkful/Bloc","<p id=""""><em id="""">I receive a lot of questions about my Data Science boot camp experience, so rather than trying to respond with full detail in an email or LinkedIn message, I probably sent you this link. While this does include a review specific to the one I&nbsp;attended (Thinkful/Bloc), it is intended to be a broader blueprint to anyone who is attending or considering a Data Science boot camp/accelerator. If I&nbsp;sent you this link, don't take it as a conversation ender - I'm totally open to discussing further!</em></p><h2 id="""">Quick Overview:</h2><p id="""">These are the main topics, which I'll write about as responses to questions I frequently hear.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Format and Content</strong>:&nbsp;Self-owned, structured study and project learning, then meet with a mentor 2x a week</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Mentorship</strong>:&nbsp;Done via video calls</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Location</strong>:&nbsp;Remote</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Duration</strong>: Pitched as 6 months, but I&nbsp;took 8 months to do some deeper dives into various projects</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Job Guarantee</strong>:&nbsp;In certain markets, including mine, the program cost was refunded if you don't get a job offer 6 months after graduation</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Cost:</strong> ~&nbsp;$8,000</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Job Search</strong>: How it went, what helped and what was tough</li></ul><p id=""""><em id="""">One disclaimer specific to Thinkful:&nbsp;The Bloc acquisition/merger happened during my program, so any changes due to that event may not be captured in my experience.</em></p><h2 id="""">Format and Content</h2><h3 id="""">What was the format of your boot camp?</h3><p id="""">Thinkful provided online content through a web portal. Assignments and projects were to be hosted on GitHub, and the links were submitted through a portal. I&nbsp;was assigned a mentor, and we were to meet via video call twice a week, 45 minutes each. There was also a slack community for smaller questions.</p><h3 id="""">What did your boot camp cover?</h3><p id="""">Thinkful started with basics of Python and Git, moved into basics of data pulling and manipulation (SQL, dataframes, etc), cleaning and pre-processing, and then machine learning and other predictive techniques. The last month of the boot camp branched into an elective capstone, with topics like Time Series forecasting, Deep Learning, or Big Data to choose from.</p><h3 id="""">How did Thinkful manage the content?</h3><p id="""">The Thinkful web content linked out to other websites <strong id=""""><em id="""">pretty</em></strong> frequently, so it can perhaps be thought of as an outline with basic content/explanations that collated useful links for deeper study. Each section ended in a hands on project - no easy/clean data provided, you had to find your own, real-world data, and apply what you learned to that dataset. For example, an assignment might be, 'Find a dataset with at least 5 continuous variables, and practice using PCA&nbsp;as a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce those to 2 feature components. Visualize the output."" All assignments like this had to be reviewed with your mentor for validation.</p><h3 id="""">It sounds like some boot camps sort of just organize content that's already out there. Couldn't I&nbsp;just replicate this learning experience on my own without paying so much money?</h3><p id="""">Hmm. Well, yes in a sense, but no. You <em id="""">technically </em>could access content that is just as good as what Thinkful provides and links. (By the way, I don't look down on them for linking to other resources. There's no need to reinvent the wheel). And if you're really, really disciplined, you could guide yourself through projects and find ways to get feedback on them. </p><p id="""">I don't think the value of my boot camp was providing/generating the content. Instead, what I&nbsp;paid for was:</p><ol start="""" id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Organization</strong>: Sure, you can find the individual resources for free, but how do you know how to <em id="""">organize</em> them into a cohesive study plan? This actually matters a lot - learning things in a logical order allows the concepts to build on each other, and jumping around - the way an overwhelmed beginner might without direction - can be very inefficient.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Community and Support</strong>:&nbsp;Even with the best resources out there, I&nbsp;got stuck pretty often. For small things, I could post in Slack and get some good debate that would clarify my understanding. For bigger things, open Q&amp;A&nbsp;sessions and my mentor meetings provided breakthroughs I&nbsp;couldn't achieve on my own.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Deadlines</strong>:&nbsp;If you have absolutely gold-tier discipline you can skip this bullet point, but for the rest of us, having concrete deadlines helps productivity. If I'd been on my own, I'd get too excited by some project and go down a many-month rabbit hole.</li></ol><h3 id="""">What was the most useful part / what made the format work for you?</h3><p id="""">HAVING&nbsp;A&nbsp;GREAT&nbsp;MENTOR. My mentor, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-ricos/"" id="""">Mike Ricos</a>, really made the program. Mike values curiosity and passion projects, and we ended up spending many hours collaborating on my projects together - hours for which he was NOT&nbsp;paid. You can't count on finding someone <em id="""">that</em> giving just anywhere, but you <em id="""">should</em> expect to have a mentor who is responsive, educational, and willing to dive deep into discussions with you.</p><p id="""">By the way, he was my 3rd mentor, which leads me to...</p><h2 id="""">Mentorship</h2><h3 id="""">What if I don't get a great mentor?</h3><p id="""">Raise this issue early and loudly!&nbsp;You are paying for this experience, don't settle! My first mentor assigned by Thinkful was very good, but she had to resign unexpectedly. My second mentor was smart, but not very educational. Our '45 minute' calls often ended early, because they would answer my questions by sending my links instead of discussing with me. I gave it a rigorous effort, but it just wasn't working, so I&nbsp;demanded a new mentor. I would've had a completely different experience if I'd just seen it through. Do not hesitate to demand the best for yourself.</p><h2 id="""">Location</h2><h3 id="""">What's your opinion on remote boot camps vs. in-person?</h3><p id="""">If you can cut it, I think remote is great - for 2 main reasons:</p><ol start="""" id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Flexibility</strong>:&nbsp;A few different times, I&nbsp;got excited about a project and went down a 2-3 week rabbit hole. These projects were super valuable for my eventual job search / interviewing. A more rigid, in-person curriculum may not allow this type of diversion.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Saved Time</strong>: Even if your commute is short, any time spent on the road is time you could be learning and studying. I value my time very highly, as should you.</li></ol><h3 id="""">What considerations should I think about to see if I&nbsp;can do a <strong id="""">remote</strong> boot camp?</h3><p id="""">Home environment, and the support network of the specific boot camp.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Home</strong>: a boot camp is challenging, especially if you have a family or a full time job. I had both, and my wife is a saint for making it though those months. I would go into my office at 7 am for my day job, and basically not emerge until 11 pm when I'd collapse into sleep. Had she been less supportive, it would've been an extremely challenging time. It goes without saying as well that you need a quiet, dedicated study space. Don't try to complete a boot camp on the couch with the TV&nbsp;on.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Their Support Network</strong>:&nbsp;Before I committed any money, Thinkful let me join their slack channel and any mentor Q&amp;A&nbsp;sessions. I&nbsp;was able to see that their community was pretty robust, and that it would do a decent job of matching the support you'd get in-person. It's probably not equally good, but it was close enough to be effective. Don't pay for a remote boot camp without validating this.</li></ul><h2 id="""">Duration</h2><h3 id="""">How long was your boot camp?</h3><p id="""">By the book?&nbsp;6 months. In reality it took me 8 months; partly because it's a tremendous amount of <em id="""">deep</em> work, and partly because I would occasionally get excited about projects and spend 2-3 weeks working on those instead of the content. The latter I don't regret at all.</p><h2 id="""">Job Guarantee</h2><h3 id="""">What is a job guarantee?</h3><p id="""">Some boot camps - including the one I&nbsp;attended - offer a conditional job guarantee. If you complete the program well, and perform an agreed-upon amount of job searching afterwards, they guarantee that you'll get a job in data science, data analysis, or data engineering. If you don't,they'll refund your tuition.</p><h3 id="""">Was it useful to have a job guarantee?</h3><p id="""">Yes, but I declined it pretty shortly after graduation. It's useful, but maybe not for the reasons you think:</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Bad</strong> Reasons to want a job guarantee:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Because it will help me get a job after I&nbsp;graduate.</em></strong> In my experience, the job guarantee <em id="""">requirements </em>for job searching were counterproductive. In order to keep the guarantee valid, I was supposed to apply to 10 jobs per week, and attend 5 networking events per month. I get why they have these requirements, but even my career adviser seemed to have mixed feelings about the arrangement. As I've stated before, I value my time highly, and this was effectively endorsing a <em id="""">quantity-over-quality</em> strategy. Anyone can go onto a LinkedIn job board, search 'Data Scientist', and click 'Quick Apply' 10 times. Those folks will also be ignored almost every time. I would much rather submit 2 highly customized, quality applications than 10 rapid-fire, generic applications. More on this in the Job Search section below. </li><li id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Because if I&nbsp;don't get a job I want my money back</em></strong>. &nbsp;This is a defeatist mentality!&nbsp;Of course you'll get a job. I&nbsp;understand wanting a safety net, but build some self-reliance and don't plan for a bail out. <a href=""https://medium.com/the-ascent/burning-the-ships-aae93a7ad1a5"">Burn your ships</a>!</li></ul><p id="""">For these reasons, I&nbsp;declined my job guarantee. However, I am glad I had it:</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Good</strong> Reasons to want a job guarantee:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Because I want LEVERAGE to ensure I&nbsp;have a good educational experience before I graduate.</em></strong> As I mentioned above, I went through 3 mentors before finding a truly great one. I have no doubt that when I&nbsp;sent in complaints or requests, boot camp admin was checking my file and seeing that if they don't take care of me, they could lose some big cash. This kind of attention makes a difference.</li><li id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Because I&nbsp;want the boot camp to have an incentive to help me with networking.</em></strong> Suppose your boot camp admin gets an audience with a company and plans to present some candidates. All else equal, they will prefer to promote candidates whose success dictates their own income.</li></ul><p id="""">In my opinion, <em id="""">this </em>is the winning mentality - use a job guarantee as a tool to further guarantee eventual success, not as a safety net for eventual failure.</p><h2 id="""">Cost</h2><p id="""">Thinkful costed about $8,000, or a bit more if you chose to pay in installments. </p><h3 id="""">Does it matter how I&nbsp;pay&nbsp;(Lump sum up front vs monthly)?</h3><p id="""">Yes. I'm not here to be a financial advisor, but if you have the choice, here are some considerations specific to the education itself:</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Monthly Payments</strong>:&nbsp;The upside to paying monthly is that if you somehow get a job before your program even ends, you can just cut the boot camp short and save some money. This may sound unlikely, but I know at least 2 colleagues who achieved this scenario. Once you have a job, why continue paying to learn? You are now <em id="""">getting paid</em> to learn! The downside is that you won't dive deep on some passion project if it means you may have to pay for additional months. These can be valuable learning opportunities.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Lump Sum</strong>:&nbsp;Conversely, the upside to paying upfront (besides typically paying less overall) is that you typically get <em id="""">some </em>(not unlimited)&nbsp;flexibility to take longer, learn more, and build more impressive portfolio projects. I found this very valuable and I believe it helped my job search succeed. The downside is that if you are one of the lucky folks who get a job early, you aren't getting a refund for unused time.</p><p id="""">As I implied, I paid a lump sum upfront.</p><h2 id="""">Job Search</h2><h3 id="""">What advice do you have for boot camp grads who are job seeking?</h3><ol start="""" id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Put time, effort, and (if necessary) money into displaying a portfolio of your work.</strong> Hence... this website. Look around here and steal some ideas!&nbsp;Notice how I have my <strong id="""">work </strong>organized in repositories on GitHub, and I&nbsp;have my <strong id="""">thought process and strategy </strong>laid out here in articles. GitHub demonstrates competence, but a site like this demonstrates communication and clarity of thought.<br>Hiring managers love content like this, because it's pressure-free; they can peruse without feeling any obligation, which means they'll be more comfortable and willing to spend time reviewing. Because of this website, GitHub, Medium, and LinkedIn, I would say about half of my interviews came from recruiters reaching out to me, instead of my own applications.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">For applications, choose quality over quantity</strong>. I alluded to this above in the 'job guarantee section'. I only applied to jobs I would actually consider. In general, I&nbsp;would first apply, then 2 days later, I'd find someone on LinkedIn on&nbsp;the company's data science team and message them. You don't need premium for this - send them a connection request, and you can include the message in the connection request for free. (It is limited by length, but that's okay, you shouldn't be writing them a book anyway.) Don't mention the job at all, just mention that you are interested in hearing what they are working on and would love to do an informational over the phone sometime. For most people that's a pretty small commitment. If possible, include some snippet in your message that shows you've researched their group/company. If that doesn't get a response within a week, find anther contact there and repeat the connection request. <br>When you speak with them, keep the conversation focused on them and their achievements. Eventually, they will probably realize they've been talking a lot and ask about your background, at which point you can casually mention that you are on the market and that 'calls like this one have proven helpful for me to understand the landscape of data science in [industry x]'. End your elevator pitch by asking for advice and/or any other data who might be willing to share their work with you (don't ask for a job referral). If you don't even get a chance to ask for advice, you can do it as a follow-up email or message. <br>Often by this point people will offer a job referral, if you've proven you aren't a crazy person. If not, you at least have a new connection and hopefully leads for more connections.<br>This is a lot of googling, reading, and researching, but it's time better spent than spam-applying 7 jobs and forgetting about them.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Let them disqualify you, don't disqualify yourself.</strong> If you saw the job description for the role I accepted, you might laugh. I&nbsp;fulfilled very little of the job requirements, which included 7+ years experience as a Data Scientist and experience with a few database platforms I had never heard of. <strong id="""">You should still apply</strong>, even if the requirements seem too intense. Let them make that decision, don't make it for them!&nbsp;Companies out there <strong id="""">don't always know what they need</strong>. What they are <em id="""">actually</em> searching for is <strong id="""">a smart person who can<em id=""""> tell them</em> what they need</strong>. Checking software boxes is not actually that important. <br>To be clear, I didn't pretend I had 7 years of experience, and I was very upfront that I&nbsp;had only done a 1 hour tutorial on the database platform they use. If you are honest but still seem confident you can learn quick and do the job, they are less likely to worry about specific software requirement</li></ol><p id=""""><em id="""">Still have questions?&nbsp;Feel free to reach out using the form on this website, or email/LinkedIn. </em></p>",startups,john-smith,

If that sounds boring to you, skip down to the Analysis section.</em></p><p><em>Filtering Columns:</em> Initially, the college scorecard was too large for my machine to import to a notebook. Fortunately, I was able to open the file in a spreadsheet to reduce the size. I removed all data prior to 2004, leaving 10 years for analysis. I also removed the columns relating to things I wasn’t interested in: Completion, Dropout, and Transfer rates, demographics besides the ones you’ll find below, figures related to loan types or grants, repayment rates, and other redundant metrics.</p><p><em>Imputing Values: </em>Once the file was importable, additional issues surfaced. Some branches had a negative net price; while it may be reasonable to think that occasionally students get scholarships that exceed their tuition and costs and actually earn money by attending school, it’s not reasonable to assume that a branch’s average price would be negative for the entire student body. These values were raised to zero.</p><p><em>Other Prominent Issues: </em>My goal was to be able to answer some demographic questions about the debt students are leaving school with. Branches did not report average debt, but did report <strong>median debt</strong>. They reported the <strong>count of total students</strong> included in the median measurement, as well as the same counts split by various demographics. I found that many of the demographic counts did not sum to the total as you’d expect (for example, the count of males and count of females would be expected to sum to the count of total students, but did not), so I converted the counts to percentages. By multiplying the median debt by the count of total students, I could theoretically achieve a <strong>Total Debt </strong>amount for all students leaving the branch in a given year. In practice, the results I was getting were unreasonably large. Particularly problematic were online-only schools, which in some cases unashamedly report a different branch for each state despite no physical presence. The study’s code book was unclear on this, but after further investigation I concluded that institutions must have reported student counts in aggregate, and each branch was mistakenly given the total. For example, the University of Phoenix, a prominent online school, reported 71 branches and each listed exactly 279,901 students — clearly incorrect.</p><p>Dividing the student count by branch before multiplying it by the median debt gave much clearer results for the branch’s <strong>Total Debt</strong>. Using the student demographic percentages, I was able to “distribute” each branch’s Total Debt across demographics to get average debts for the following categories:</p><ul><li>Male/Female</li><li>First-Generation Student / Not First-Generation Student</li><li>Family Income bracket in annual nominal dollars: under 30K, 30–75K, and 75K+</li></ul><h3>Descriptive Statistics</h3><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1400px"" style=""max-width:1400px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c7abed29254e9f90fc127aa/5cb10b0e37cbae33480298f2_stats.png""></div></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Analysis</h3><p>One of the many factors contributing to the student debt crisis is the rising price of higher education.

As seen below, there was no found correlation between the median debt for a branch and the death rate of its past students, which would’ve been a very concerning suggestion that the increasing debt amounts were negatively influencing mental health or some other cause of death. At a minimum, I’m happy to report no meaningful correlation.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c7abed29254e9f90fc127aa/5cb10c3edfaff5b05b339050_death.png""></div></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Can your sex predict how much you’ll borrow for school?</strong></h4><p>Since each school reported median debts figures for their students and noted how many of their students were male or female, I was able to calculate how much of their <em>total</em> debt for that year went to males and how much went to females. By dividing those by the number of respective males/female students, I was able to calculate an average male/female debt by branch. The two distributions of all the branches is seen below:</p><p><br></p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""738px"" style=""max-width:738px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c7abed29254e9f90fc127aa/5cb10c502edee07a4e7d94f7_sex%20-%20Copy.png""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>As a reminder, each row in this data set is a branch of an institution. Therefore, this is a distribution of the average individual debt obligations for the males/females at the branch level.

A perfect model would have only True Positives and True Negatives. A purely random model will have all 4 categories in similar quantities. If you have a class imbalance problem, typically you'll see many Negatives (True and False both) and few Positives, or vice versa. For a great example of this, see my project on <a href=""https://www.gregcondit.com/projects/disrupt"" data-rt-link-type=""external"">Predicting Disruption</a>.</p><h4>Center Chart:&nbsp;Distributions of Predictions</h4><p>The Center Graph is the distribution of predicted probabilities of a Positive Outcome. For example, If your model is 100% sure a sample is positive, if will be in the far right bin. The two different colors indicate the TRUE&nbsp;class, not the predicted class. A perfect model would show no overlap at all between the green and red distributions. A purely random model will see them overlap each other entirely. </p><p>The <strong>decision boundary</strong> decides the model's final predictions. In scikit-learn, the default <strong>decision boundary</strong> is .5; that is, anything above .5 is predicted as a 1 (positive) and anything below .5 is predicted as a 0 (negative). This is an important detail for understanding your model.</p><h4>Right Chart: The ROC&nbsp;Curve</h4><p>The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve describes <em>all possible </em><strong>decision boundaries</strong>. The green curve represents the possibilities, and the trade off between the True Positive Rate and the False Positive Rate at different decision points. The extremes are easy to understand:&nbsp;your model could lazily predict 1 for ALL&nbsp;samples and achieve a perfect True Positive Rate but it would also have a False Positive Rate of 1. Similarly, you could reduce your False Positive rate to zero by predicting everything as Negative, but your True Positive Rate would also be zero. The value in your model is its ability to increase the True Positive Rate <em>faster </em>than it increases the False Positive Rate. </p><p>A perfect model would be a vertical line up the y-axis (100%&nbsp;True Positives, 0%&nbsp;False Positives). A purely random model would right on the blue dotted line (to find more True Positives means an equal number of False Positives). </p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c7abed29254e9f90fc127aa/5ca2e65f50cb2e39711ebc4e_perf_rand.png""></div><figcaption>Left:&nbsp;a perfect model; Right:&nbsp;a purely random model</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>The Blue dot represents the .5 decision boundary that is currently determining the Confusion Matrix. Changing this is a useful way to adjust the sensitivity of your model when one error type is worse than another. </p><p>Healthcare is full of these decisions:&nbsp;Incorrectly diagnosing cancer is WAY&nbsp;better than incorrectly diagnosing good health. In that case, we'd want a very low decision boundary, which is to say, only predict a negative&nbsp;result (no cancer) if we're VERY&nbsp;sure about it. </p><p>If you chose a different boundary using this same model (ex:&nbsp;.3 instead of .5), the blue dot would move up and to the right along the green curve. The new boundary means we'd capture more True Positives, and also more False Positives. This is also easily visualized as the blue line in the center chart moving to the left until it's on 0.3:&nbsp;There would be more ""green"" bins to the right of the boundary, but also more ""red"" bins.</p><p>scikit-learn does not have a built-in way to adjust the decision boundary, but this can be done easily by calling the predict_proba() method on your data, and then manually coding a decision based on the boundary of your choice.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Did this help you understand your model?
